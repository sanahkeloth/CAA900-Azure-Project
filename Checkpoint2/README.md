## Part B: Inspecting Local Repo with `git status` and `git log`

**Q) How do these two commands differ - `git status` vs `git log`? Elaborate with an example.**

`git status` shows the status of your local working directory since the last commit, covering untracked, uncommitted, and committed changes. It also provides details about the current local branch in relation to the remote repository. On the other hand, `git log` is used to examine the commit history details. In short, `git status` deals with the current state of your working directory and `git log` focuses on the historical record of commits in the repository.
